##MealTracker

This Android application allows you to effortlessly track your food intake, including the source and associated expenditure. Gain valuable insights into your eating habits and manage your spending effectively.

Getting Started

These instructions guide you through setting up the MealTracker project on your development machine.

Prerequisites

Android Studio (Download from https://developer.android.com/studio)
Android SDK (See installation instructions in Android Studio)
Installation

Clone the Repository:

Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine.

Configure Android SDK:

Android Studio requires the Android SDK to build and run Android apps. There are two ways to configure this:

local.properties File:

Navigate to the MealTracker directory in your file explorer.

If the local.properties file doesn't exist, create a new text file named local.properties.

Open local.properties and add the following line, replacing the path with the actual location of your Android SDK:

sdk.dir=/path/to/your/android/sdk
ANDROID_HOME Environment Variable (Optional):

This method sets the SDK location system-wide. Refer to the official Android Studio documentation for detailed instructions specific to your operating system (https://developer.android.com/tools/variables).

Sync Project:

Open the MealTracker project in Android Studio.
Click the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" button (usually an elephant icon) in the toolbar.
Additional Notes

If you encounter issues during setup, consider invalidating caches and restarting Android Studio (File > Invalidate Caches / Restart > Invalidate and Restart).
